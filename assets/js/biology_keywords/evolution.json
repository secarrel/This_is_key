      "word": "Antibiotic resistance",
      "definition": "The ability of a bacteria to become resistant to the treatment that is being used to kill it, i.e. antibiotics. This provides evidence for evolution."

      "word": "Natural selection",
      "definition": "The process by which advantageous alleles are passed down to offspring over many generations, increasing the allele frequency. These alleles give rise to phenotypes best suited to the environment."
